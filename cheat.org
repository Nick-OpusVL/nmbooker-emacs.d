** Keyboard macros, local bindings, repeats
https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/KeyboardMacros
| F3...F4     | record                                           |
| F4          | run keyboard macro                               |
| C-x C-k C-r | macro is run from beginning of each region line  |

For many movement commands, and for running keyboard macros, numeric argument is repeat.

| C-<n> F4 | repeat kbd macro <n> times (e.g. C-5 F4) |
| C-0 F4   | repeat kbd macro to (end of buffer?)     |
|          | (hopefully narrowing will affect this!)  |

| name-last-kbd-macro                        | name (in memory) last defined keyboard macro. Execute it with M-x |
| insert-kbd-macro                           | insert keyboard macro definition at point                         |
| (execute-kbd-macro (symbol-function 'foo)) | call a keyboard macro from lisp                                   |
| local-set-key                              | Temporarily bind a key locally to a command                       |

** Text Editing

Observation - in at least some cases, the C-M-<x> variant is the semantic 'block' version

| M-c     | title-case word                                                |
| C-t     | transpose chars                                                |
| M-t     | transpose words                                                |
| C-x C-t | transpose lines                                                |
| C-M-t   | transpose sexps (rebound to org-transpose-element in org-mode) |
|         | In Python, put point on blank line at end of item you want to  |
|         | move down                                                      |

** Navigation

Go-to whatever   help at:   M-g C-h

| C-M-n, C-M-p | go to matching paren (does this work for XML/HTML tags?) |
| M-{,  M-}    | TODO find out what proper definitioin is                 |

** Dired
| C-x C-j | dired-jump - jump to dired buffer corresponding to current buffer |

** Lining stuff up
| M-x indent-to-column NUMBER RET | Insert spaces to line up with column NUMBER |
| C-M-\                           | Indent region                               |

** Kills
| C-shift-Backspace | kill whole line (anywhere on line)                                     |
| C-M-k             | kill sexp (works in Python too - put in word that introduces the sexp) |

** semantic selection
| expand-region | expand region to include enclosing semantic region of code |

** Stuff to learn about creating
   - Transient keymaps
   - Minor modes

** Notes from watching magnar's talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3Te_a-AGqM

   - [ ] align-regexp
   - [ ] ace-jump
   - javascript refactoring - look to this for base for Perl and Python refactoring?
   - commands to make or jump to test file corresponding to class
   - annoying arrows mode (to tell me if I could use a shortcut to do the same thing?)

   - defadvice sgml-delete-tag 13:10
   - undo tree 15:18
   - macros work across buffer (so start in dired for example and do something on each file in turn)
   - grep mode
   - there's also ag/ack!
   - editing stuff from grep buffer at 16:45?  anything special installed to do this?
   - use dired with emacs
   - [ ] how to get short listing in dired?

** Libraries I've found which might be useful later
   - let-alist - macro to easily let alist values
   - epc - communicate with other programs
   - ctable - table component for emacs lisp - https://github.com/kiwanami/emacs-ctable

** Applications/modes/etc I've found which might be useful later
   - iedit (minor mode) - Edit multiple regions in the same way simultaneously, could be alternative or complement to multiple-cursors, looks good for renaming refactors!
   - sql
   - sql-indent
   - yasnippet - snippets
   - company - autocompletion
   - edbi - Database interface for Emacs Lisp, and viewer
   - E2WM - window manager for emacs - https://github.com/kiwanami/emacs-window-manager/
   - https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/WebKit - browser
   - ac-html - auto-complete source for html tags and attributes
   - ac-html-bootstrap - auto-complete bootstrap3/fontawesome classes
   - https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Repeatable
   - iy-go-to-char - vim-like go to char, go up to char, etc
   - key-chord
   - magnars' mark-multiple
   - ace-jump - see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZkpmegySnc

** Ideas of stuff to write
   - Odoo XML and HTML5 completion sources

** Possible refactoring tools
   - emr - https://github.com/chrisbarrett/emacs-refactor - looks very good
   - iedit - for Rename
